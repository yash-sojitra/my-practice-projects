6. git branch -a (to list all branches)

7. git branch -d <branch-name> (to delete a local branch)

8. git push origin -d <branch-name> (to delete the remote branch) (the branch which is still there in Github)

9. To push a remote branch.

It means that you don't have your branch(the branch that you want to push) in your remote repository, in other words it does not exist in your remote repository(it wasn't created yet)... So use this Code:

git push -u origin 'your branch name'

This code will create your branch in your remote repository and will push it...
