            <p>London is the capital city of England. It is the most populous
                city in the United Kingdom, with a metropolitan area of over 13

            <p>Standing on the River Thames, London has been a major settlement
                for two millennia, its history going back to its founding by the
                Romans, who named it Londinium.</p>
